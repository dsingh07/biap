Project Status
==============

This is a fairly new project, while this package is utilised in production on
several projects the status will remain as beta until unit-test coverage has
been expanded. Documentation is now fairly complete, in general areas of the
code base that have not been documented should be considered unstable.

============

Examples of this include:

* additional decorators

* greatly expanded collection of default response classes

See :doc:`ref/index` full reference.
